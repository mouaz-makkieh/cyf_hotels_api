# HOTELS API

This is the api code created for the hotels exercise during the class on Node and databases in the Migracode Barcelona course (A great project, learn about it on https://migracode.openculturalcenter.org/).

This project is an example on how to create a basic api storing and retrieving information from a database.

## How to make it work

In order to run this project you must:

* Download the project
* Copy the file `secrets.example.js` to `secrets.js`
* Edit `secrets.js` and set your database password
* Execute `npm install` in order to install all dependencies
* Execute `npm start` to launch the server
* Get fun

You will need to have the hotels PostgreSQL database made during the course. You can find information on how to create it on (https://migracode-barcelona.github.io/syllabus/db/week-2/lesson.html)
